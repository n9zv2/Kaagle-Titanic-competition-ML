# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the Titanic dataset and evaluated using the accuracy score.

## Steps to Create the Model

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.

2. **Load the Data:**
   - Load the Titanic dataset using pandas.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values by filling or dropping them as appropriate.
   - Convert categorical variables (like 'Sex' and 'Embarked') into numerical values.
   - Drop unnecessary columns that do not contribute to the prediction.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Select relevant features that will be used to train the model.

5. **Split the Data:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

6. **Train the Model:**
   - Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data.

7. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Make predictions on the test data and evaluate the model using the accuracy score.
